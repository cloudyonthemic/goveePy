# Govee Control Script ðŸŒˆðŸ’¡

## Overview
This Python script allows you to control Govee LED devices using the pygovee library. There are two main files in this repository:

1. `devices.py`: This script retrieves a list of Govee devices connected to your account, providing their MAC addresses and model numbers. It helps you identify the devices you want to control in the `main.py` script.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- pygovee library

## Installation
1. Install the required library using the following command:
   ```bash
   pip install pygovee
   

## Usage

1. Run `devices.py` to get a list of your Govee devices and their details.
2. Note the MAC address and model number of the device you want to control.
3. Open `main.py` in a text editor.
4. Replace the placeholder API key (`"API_KEY"`) with your Govee API key.
5. Replace `"MAC_ADDRESS"` and `"MODEL"` with the actual MAC address and model number of your Govee device.
6. Save the changes.
